Powerup Implementation Idea:
    - Question will pop up @ various intervals
    - Player will select a question tier/difficulty
    - Player will be asked a question with a time limit
    - If player gets question right, buff will be added. If wrong, nothing happens/nerf happens
    - Time limit on questions
    - Probably start with 3 tiers of questions. 
    - Use randomized math questions to start with
